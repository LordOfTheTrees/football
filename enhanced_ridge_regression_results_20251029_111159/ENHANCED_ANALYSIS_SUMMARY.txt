STATISTICAL INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
================================================================================

SIGNIFICANCE TESTING (Wins Prediction):
- Significant_95 = True: Variable is statistically significant (95% confidence)
- P_Value_Bootstrap < 0.05: Strong evidence of real effect
- T_Statistic: Coefficient divided by standard error (larger = more significant)
- CI bounds: If both positive or both negative, effect is significant

CONFUSION MATRIX (Payment Prediction):
- True Positives (TP): Correctly predicted "gets paid"
- False Positives (FP): Incorrectly predicted "gets paid" 
- True Negatives (TN): Correctly predicted "doesn't get paid"
- False Negatives (FN): Incorrectly predicted "doesn't get paid"

- Precision = TP/(TP+FP): Of predicted pays, how many were correct?
- Recall = TP/(TP+FN): Of actual pays, how many did we catch?
- F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall (balanced metric)
- ROC AUC: Overall discriminative ability (0.5 = random, 1.0 = perfect)

BUSINESS IMPLICATIONS:
================================================================================

FOR WINS PREDICTION:
- Use only statistically significant variables for reliable predictions
- Focus on variables with largest T-statistics for maximum impact
- Consider confidence intervals when making personnel decisions

FOR PAYMENT PREDICTION:  
- Use optimal threshold for binary classification decisions
- Higher precision = fewer "false alarms" (wrongly predicting payment)
- Higher recall = catch more QBs who actually get paid
- Choose threshold based on cost of false positives vs false negatives

NEXT STEPS:
================================================================================

1. Review significance test results to identify most reliable predictors
2. Examine confusion matrix to understand prediction accuracy limitations  
3. Consider ensemble methods if single model performance is insufficient
4. Validate findings on additional data or different time periods
5. Implement decision framework using optimal probability thresholds
