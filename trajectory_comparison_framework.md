## III. COMPARISON FRAMEWORK FOR ARTICLE 4

### Section III: Trajectory Comparison Case Studies

**Recommended Structure:**

#### Case Study 1: Elite Early Developer vs. Current Prospects
**Comparable:** Josh Allen trajectory (2018-2021)
**Current Evaluation Target:** C.J. Stroud (2023 class)

| Metric | Josh Allen Y1-Y2 | C.J. Stroud Y1-Y2 | Variance |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Y1 ANY/A | 4.42 | 6.30 | +1.88 (Stroud ahead) |
| Y2 ANY/A | 5.77 | 5.44 | -0.33 (Allen ahead) |
| Y1 Yards | 2,749 | 4,135 | +1,386 (Stroud ahead) |
| Y2 Yards | 3,648 | 3,960 | +312 (Stroud ahead) |
| Y1-Y2 Growth | +1.35 ANY/A | -0.86 ANY/A | Divergent paths |

**Analysis Points:**
- Stroud's superior Year 1 vs. Allen's growth trajectory
- Allen's continuous improvement vs. Stroud's Year 2 regression
- Key question: Is Stroud's Year 2 dip a temporary adjustment or warning sign?
- Contract probability implications based on Year 3 projection

---

#### Case Study 2: Late Bloomer Pattern Recognition
**Comparable:** Jordan Love trajectory (2020-2023)
**Current Evaluation Targets:** Anthony Richardson, Trey Lance

| Player | Y1 Status | Y2 Status | Y3 Opportunity | Pattern Match |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Jordan Love | Backup (442 yds) | Backup (195 yds) | Starter: 4,418 yds, 6.68 ANY/A | Full pattern |
| Anthony Richardson | Limited (1,933 yds, 5.03 ANY/A) | Injured (2,313 yds, 4.74 ANY/A) | Y3 critical | Incomplete |
| Trey Lance | Very limited (741 yds, 4.80 ANY/A) | Backup/injured | Minimal opportunity | Failed opportunity |

**Analysis Points:**
- Love demonstrated immediate competence when given full control
- Richardson needs Year 3 health + volume to validate potential
- Lance's trajectory diverged due to lack of opportunity/fit

---

#### Case Study 3: Steady Improver Baseline
**Comparable:** Ryan Tannehill trajectory (2012-2015)
**Current Evaluation Targets:** Trevor Lawrence, Mac Jones

| Metric | Tannehill Path | Trevor Lawrence | Mac Jones |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Y1 ANY/A | 5.36 | 4.57 | 5.96 |
| Y2 ANY/A | 5.11 | 6.69 | 4.81 |
| Y3 ANY/A | 5.95 | 5.99 | 5.02 |
| Y4 ANY/A | 6.02 | 5.99 | 4.97 |
| Contract | Year 4 | **Year 3 (PAID)** | Pending |

**Analysis Points:**
- Lawrence matched Tannehill's gradual improvement, earned early extension
- Jones regressed after strong rookie year (Early Peak archetype risk)
- Tannehill established 5.5+ ANY/A floor before extension

---

#### Case Study 4: Early Peak Risk Assessment
**Comparable:** Blake Bortles trajectory (2014-2018)
**Current Evaluation Targets:** Zach Wilson, Justin Fields

| Player | Y2 Performance | Y3+ Pattern | Contract Outcome |
|--------|----------------|-------------|------------------|
| Bortles | 4,855 yds, 6.20 ANY/A | Regression to 5.3-5.4 ANY/A | Extended Y4, cut Y5 |
| Zach Wilson | 1,800 yds, 4.99 ANY/A (limited) | Y3: 2,489 yds, 4.30 ANY/A | High risk |
| Justin Fields | 3,143 yds, 6.03 ANY/A | Y3-Y4: 5.86-5.74 ANY/A | Traded (no extension) |

**Analysis Points:**
- Bortles' Year 2 spike led to mistaken extension
- Wilson never achieved Year 2 competence (below Early Peak threshold)
- Fields showed steadier profile than Wilson but lacked elite ceiling

### Performance Inflection Points Summary

**Critical Thresholds for Contract Probability:**

| Year | Minimum ANY/A | Target ANY/A | Minimum Yards |
|------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Year 1 | 5.0 | 5.5+ | 2,500 |
| Year 2 | 5.5 | 6.0+ | 3,200 |
| **Year 3** | **6.0** | **6.5+** | **3,800** |
| Year 4 (contract) | 6.3 | 6.8+ | 4,000 |

**Growth Requirements:**
- Year 1 to Year 3 improvement: Minimum +0.8 ANY/A, Target +1.5 ANY/A
- No season below 5.0 ANY/A after Year 2
- Year 3 regression from Year 2 by more than 1.0 ANY/A = high risk

---

## IV. STRATEGIC APPLICATIONS

### For Teams: Contract Timing Optimization

**Extension Decision Framework:**

**Tier 1: Extend Early (Post-Year 3)**
- Criteria: 6.5+ ANY/A in Year 3, upward trajectory, Top 10 volume
- Examples: Josh Allen, Joe Burrow, Patrick Mahomes
- Risk: Minimal - elite performance established
- Cost Savings: $5-8M AAV vs. waiting for Year 4 market
- **Current Candidates:** C.J. Stroud (if Y3 rebounds), Jayden Daniels (if sustained)

**Tier 2: Wait-and-See (Through Year 4)**
- Criteria: 5.8-6.3 ANY/A, inconsistent efficiency, questions remain
- Examples: Ryan Tannehill, Derek Carr, Matt Ryan
- Risk: Moderate - potential overpay if Year 4 spike
- Cost Impact: Market rate, no discount
- **Current Candidates:** Anthony Richardson, Bryce Young

**Tier 3: Fifth-Year Option / Tag**
- Criteria: Below 5.8 ANY/A in Year 3, declining trajectory, major concerns
- Examples: Blake Bortles, Marcus Mariota, Daniel Jones
- Risk: High - likely misallocated capital
- Strategy: Exercise option, evaluate in contract year
- **Current Candidates:** Mac Jones, Justin Fields (new team)

**Tier 4: Move On**
- Criteria: Sub-5.0 ANY/A in Year 3, no improvement trajectory
- Examples: Zach Wilson, Trey Lance, Kyle Boller
- Strategy: Decline option, draft replacement
- **Current Candidates:** Zach Wilson, Kenny Pickett

---

### For Agents: Negotiation Timing Strategies

**Maximize Value Scenarios:**

**Early Extension (Post-Year 2):**
- Client Profile: Top 5 pick, elite Year 1-2 performance
- Precedent: Patrick Mahomes approach
- Strategy: Lock in before Year 3 market inflation
- Risk: Client foregoes potential Year 3 spike value
- **Current Opportunity:** Jayden Daniels (if Year 2 matches Year 1)

**Standard Timeline (Post-Year 3):**
- Client Profile: Established franchise QB, clear trajectory
- Precedent: Josh Allen, Joe Burrow
- Strategy: Demonstrate Year 3 consistency, negotiate early Year 4
- Risk: Minimal if performance maintained
- **Current Opportunity:** C.J. Stroud

**Delayed Extension (Year 4/5):**
- Client Profile: Late bloomer, inconsistent early career
- Precedent: Ryan Tannehill, Derek Carr
- Strategy: Play on fifth-year option, maximize contract year
- Risk: Injury or regression tanks value
- **Current Opportunity:** Anthony Richardson (needs health), Bryce Young (needs breakout)

---

### Performance Benchmark Targeting for Contract Maximization

**Position Client for Top-Tier Deal ($50M+ AAV):**
- Year 3: 6.8+ ANY/A, 4,500+ yards, playoff appearance
- Comparable: Josh Allen Year 3 (7.88 ANY/A) → $43M deal (2021)
- Market Adjusted (2025-27): $52-58M AAV

**Position Client for Mid-Tier Deal ($40-50M AAV):**
- Year 3: 6.3-6.7 ANY/A, 4,000+ yards, 9+ wins
- Comparable: Trevor Lawrence Year 3 (5.99 ANY/A) → $55M deal (2024)
- Note: Lawrence benefited from QB market inflation, not pure performance

**Position Client for Prove-It Extension ($30-40M AAV):**
- Year 3: 5.8-6.2 ANY/A, adequate volume, mixed results
- Comparable: Daniel Jones Year 4 (5.91 ANY/A) → $40M deal (2023)
- Risk: Team likely regrets deal if no further growth

---

### For Analysts: Market Inefficiency Identification

**Undervalued Profiles:**

1. **Late-Round Picks with Elite Early Developer Trajectory**
   - Historical: Lamar Jackson (Pick 32), Russell Wilson (Pick 75)
   - Current Watch: Bo Nix (Pick 12 - showing immediate competence)
   - Inefficiency: Draft position bias suppresses perceived value
   - Opportunity: Teams hesitant to extend "lower pedigree" QBs early

2. **Late Bloomers with Limited Sample Size**
   - Historical: Jordan Love (3 years backup → immediate success)
   - Current Watch: Anthony Richardson (injury-limited sample)
   - Inefficiency: Market underweights talent due to opportunity gap
   - Opportunity: Acquire before breakout season

3. **Year 3 Regression Overreaction**
   - Historical: Trevor Lawrence Y3 dip (5.99 ANY/A) → still extended
   - Pattern: Single-year regression often rebounds
   - Current Watch: C.J. Stroud Year 2 decline
   - Opportunity: Buy "dip" if underlying metrics strong

**Overvalued Profiles:**

1. **Early Peak QBs Post-Year 2**
   - Historical: Blake Bortles (Y2: 6.20 ANY/A → extended → bust)
   - Warning Signs: Year 2 spike, Year 3 regression
   - Current Watch: Mac Jones peaked Y1, steady decline
   - Risk: Mistaking variance for growth

2. **High Volume, Low Efficiency Producers**
   - Historical: Jameis Winston (5,400 yards, 6.21 ANY/A → not extended)
   - Pattern: Yards without efficiency = unsustainable
   - Current Watch: Caleb Williams (4,030 yards, 5.09 ANY/A)
   - Risk: Volume masks fundamental limitations

3. **Top-5 Pick Bias Premium**
   - Historical: Sam Bradford, David Carr, Baker Mayfield
   - Pattern: Draft capital creates sunk cost fallacy
   - Current Example: Bryce Young (worst ANY/A, still viewed as franchise QB)
   - Risk: Organizational pressure to validate pick overrides data

## VI. SUMMARY: KEY INSIGHTS FOR ARTICLE 4

### Critical Findings for Trajectory Comparison Section:

1. **Year 3 is the Determinant Season**
   - 6.63 ANY/A median for paid QBs vs. 5.30 for unpaid
   - 1.37 ANY/A gap is the strongest predictor of contract outcome
   - Volume threshold: 3,800+ yards minimum for extension consideration

2. **Growth Trajectory Matters More Than Draft Position**
   - Top 5 picks: 31.4% contract rate
   - Picks 6-15: 36.8% contract rate
   - Late Round (16-32): 31.6% contract rate
   - **Conclusion:** Performance curve trumps draft capital

3. **Four Distinct Career Archetypes with Predictive Power**
   - Elite Early Developer: Highest success rate (90%+), explosive Year 2-3
   - Steady Improver: Moderate success (70%), incremental growth required
   - Late Bloomer: Variable (50-75%), dependent on opportunity timing
   - Early Peak: Highest bust rate (60% failure), Year 2 spike misleading

4. **Current Market Stratification (2021-2024 Classes)**
   - High Confidence (>70%): C.J. Stroud, Jayden Daniels, Bo Nix
   - Development Watch (30-70%): Anthony Richardson, Bryce Young, Justin Fields, Caleb Williams
   - Low Probability (<30%): Zach Wilson, Trey Lance, Kenny Pickett, Mac Jones

5. **Market Inefficiencies to Exploit**
   - Undervalued: Late-round picks with immediate competence (Bo Nix model)
   - Overvalued: Early Peak QBs post-Year 2 (Bortles/Mariota trap)
   - Hidden Value: Limited-sample Late Bloomers (Richardson/Love model)
