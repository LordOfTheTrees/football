================================================================================

üéØ RESEARCH QUESTION ANSWERED:
"Which prior performance years are statistically significant predictors of QB payment decisions?"

ANALYSIS OVERVIEW:
================================================================================

‚úÖ FIXED ISSUES:
- Uses LogisticRegression instead of Ridge for binary classification
- Properly handles coefficient arrays (1D extraction from 2D)
- Defines all bootstrap statistics variables correctly
- Uses McFadden's Pseudo-R¬≤ for logistic regression

‚úÖ STATISTICAL RIGOR:
- 1000 bootstrap samples for robust p-value estimation
- 95% confidence intervals for all coefficients
- Two-tailed significance testing
- Controls for multiple comparisons

‚úÖ METRICS ANALYZED:
- total_yards_adj (era-adjusted total offensive yards)
- Pass_ANY/A_adj (era-adjusted passing efficiency)

DECISION YEARS TESTED:
================================================================================

üìä Decision Year 3: After Year 2 performance (5th year option decision)
üìä Decision Year 4: After Year 3 performance (typical extension timing)
üìä Decision Year 5: After Year 4 performance (late extension)
üìä Decision Year 6: After Year 5 performance (2nd contract)

For each decision year, tests significance of Years 0, 1, 2, ... up to (decision_year - 1)

KEY OUTPUT FILES:
================================================================================

üîç DETAILED P-VALUE RESULTS:
‚≠ê year_weights_significance_total_yards_adj.csv
‚≠ê year_weights_significance_Pass_ANY_A_adj.csv

These files contain for each metric and decision year:
- Performance_Year: Which prior year (Year 0, Year 1, etc.)
- Coefficient: Effect size (positive = increases payment probability)
- P_Value_Bootstrap: Statistical p-value from bootstrap testing
- Significant_95: True/False for statistical significance (p < 0.05)
- CI_Lower_95, CI_Upper_95: 95% confidence interval bounds
- T_Statistic: Coefficient / Standard Error

üîç SUMMARY MATRICES:
- year_significance_matrix_*.csv: True/False significance by (year, decision_year)
- year_pvalue_matrix_*.csv: P-values by (year, decision_year)
- year_weight_matrix_*.csv: Importance weights by (year, decision_year)

INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
================================================================================

üìà P-VALUE INTERPRETATION:
- p < 0.05: Statistically significant (95% confidence)
- p < 0.01: Highly significant (99% confidence)
- p < 0.001: Very highly significant (99.9% confidence)

üìà COEFFICIENT INTERPRETATION:
- Positive: Higher performance in that year ‚Üí Higher payment probability
- Negative: Higher performance in that year ‚Üí Lower payment probability
- Magnitude: Larger absolute value = stronger effect

üìà CONFIDENCE INTERVALS:
- If both CI bounds are positive or both negative ‚Üí Significant effect
- If CI spans zero ‚Üí Not statistically significant
- Width indicates precision of estimate

BUSINESS INSIGHTS:
================================================================================

üéØ SCOUTING FOCUS:
Years with consistently low p-values across decision years should receive
the most attention in QB evaluation processes.

üéØ CONTRACT TIMING:
Years that become significant later (higher decision years) suggest
when those performance periods become most relevant for decisions.

üéØ EVALUATION WEIGHTS:
Use Weight_% from significant years to create data-driven evaluation
frameworks rather than arbitrary weightings.

HOW TO USE THE RESULTS:
================================================================================

1. üìä Open year_weights_significance_*.csv in Excel/spreadsheet

2. üîç Filter for Significant_95 = True to see only significant years

3. üìà Sort by P_Value_Bootstrap (ascending) to see most significant first

4. üéØ Look for patterns:
   - Which years are significant across multiple decision years?
   - Do recent years (Year 2, 3) matter more than rookie year (Year 0)?
   - Are there differences between yards vs efficiency metrics?

5. üìù Create evaluation framework:
   - Weight years by their statistical significance
   - Focus on consistently significant performance periods
   - Adjust timing of contract decisions based on which years matter when

EXPECTED FINDINGS:
================================================================================

Based on NFL contract patterns, you might find:

üîÆ ROOKIE YEAR (Year 0):
Likely significant for early decisions but less important for later contracts
as more recent performance becomes available.

üîÆ YEAR 2-3 PERFORMANCE:
Probably most significant for typical extension timing (Decision Year 4)
as these represent the most recent substantial performance data.

üîÆ METRIC DIFFERENCES:
Total yards (volume) vs ANY/A (efficiency) may show different patterns
of year importance, reflecting different aspects of QB evaluation.

NEXT STEPS:
================================================================================

1. ‚úÖ Examine detailed p-value results in CSV files
2. üìä Create visualizations of significance patterns
3. üîç Compare findings between volume (yards) and efficiency (ANY/A) metrics
4. üìù Document business rules based on statistically significant years
5. üéØ Implement data-driven weighting in QB evaluation processes

STATISTICAL VALIDATION:
================================================================================

‚úÖ Bootstrap Method: Robust to outliers and small sample issues
‚úÖ Multiple Testing: Aware of multiple comparisons across years
‚úÖ Effect Size: Coefficients provide practical significance beyond p-values
‚úÖ Model Fit: Pseudo-R¬≤ indicates explanatory power of year-by-year model
