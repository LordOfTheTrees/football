================================================================================

🎯 ALL ISSUES FIXED!

This analysis uses the corrected statistical methods throughout:

✅ PAYMENT PREDICTION FIXES:
- Uses LogisticRegression instead of Ridge for binary classification
- Proper coefficient handling (1D extraction from 2D arrays)
- Confusion matrix with precision, recall, F1-score
- ROC AUC for binary classification performance

✅ YEAR WEIGHTING FIXES:
- Uses LogisticRegression instead of Ridge for binary outcomes
- Properly defines all bootstrap statistics variables
- McFadden's Pseudo-R² for logistic regression model fit
- Robust statistical significance testing with p-values

✅ WINS PREDICTION:
- Original Ridge regression (appropriate for continuous wins outcome)
- No changes needed - this was already correct

INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
================================================================================

🔍 PAYMENT PREDICTION (Logistic Regression):
- Positive coefficients: Increase payment probability
- Negative coefficients: Decrease payment probability
- Magnitude: Effect size (larger absolute value = stronger effect)
- ROC AUC > 0.7: Good discriminative ability

🔍 YEAR WEIGHTING (Logistic Regression with Bootstrap):
- P_Value_Bootstrap < 0.05: Statistically significant year
- Significant_95 = True: 95% confidence that effect is real
- Coefficient: Direction and magnitude of year's influence
- CI bounds: Precision of effect estimate

🔍 WINS PREDICTION (Ridge Regression):
- Coefficients: Change in wins per 1 standard deviation increase
- R²: Proportion of win variance explained by QB performance
- RMSE: Average prediction error in wins

BUSINESS IMPLICATIONS:
================================================================================

🎯 PAYMENT DECISIONS:
- Use logistic model probabilities for binary decisions
- Optimal threshold balances precision vs recall
- Focus on statistically significant predictors

🎯 YEAR WEIGHTING:
- Prioritize performance years with low p-values
- Weight recent vs early years based on statistical significance
- Timing of evaluations based on which years matter when

🎯 WINS PREDICTION:
- QB performance explains significant portion of team wins
- Use for player evaluation and value assessment
- Consider uncertainty (RMSE) in decision making
