================================================================================

ANALYSES COMPLETED:

1. WINS PREDICTION (Extended Features)
   - File: wins_prediction_ridge_extended.txt
   - Features: 10 performance factors (top PC1 loadings)
   - Output: R², RMSE, variable importance, test performance

2. WINS PREDICTION (Original Features) 
   - File: wins_prediction_ridge_original.txt
   - Features: 5 core performance factors (manual selection)
   - Output: R², RMSE, variable importance, test performance

3. PAYMENT PROBABILITY PREDICTION
   - File: payment_probability_ridge.txt
   - Features: Averaged performance (Years 1-3)
   - Output: R², classification metrics, variable importance
   - Note: Uses eligible QBs (drafted ≤2020)

4. YEAR WEIGHTING ANALYSIS
   - Files: year_weighting_total_yards.txt, year_weighting_any_a.txt
   - Analysis: How each prior year is weighted in payment decisions
   - Output: Year-by-year coefficients and importance weights

KEY FILES TO CHECK:
- Variable importance CSVs are automatically saved by the functions
- Look for files like: ridge_regression_variable_importance.csv
- Payment prediction importance: payment_prediction_importance.csv
- Year weights: year_weights_*.csv

NOTES:
- All functions use proper train/test splits for unbiased evaluation
- Ridge regression includes cross-validation for alpha selection
- Statistical significance testing is built into the functions
- Payment probability analysis includes confusion matrix-like metrics
