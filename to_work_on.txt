organize, group, and sanitize the workflow of my code to be more comprehensible to others

create more data validation functions

set up scripts to auto run

to investigate:
//////////////////////////////////////////later//////////////////////////////////

Add in all the other rounds of QBs

What is the most predictive with % of salary cap at signing
    what is second beyond year of signing? (assuming this is nr 1)

Groups by draft slot (e.g., picks 1-5, 6-10, 11-20, 21-32)
Returns: Average trajectory + confidence intervals

compare_qb_to_slot_average(qb_trajectory, slot_average)
