fix wins regression to also use adjusment when present (why not)

compare reduced payment era adjustment (ANY/A = eff, total yards=vol) to current era adjustment

re-upload my regression visuals

organize, group, and sanitize the workflow of my code to be more comprehensible to others

create more data validation functions

set up scripts to auto run

to investigate:
//////////////////////////////////////////later//////////////////////////////////

What is the probability for payment of the unsigned QBs in their last year at the team (year0-6)

Who are the most similar profiles from the data set of all QBs?

Add in all the other rounds of QBs

What is the most predictive with % of salary cap at signing
    what is second beyond year of signing? (assuming this is nr 1)

Comparison & Analysis Functions

get_draft_slot_average_trajectory(draft_position, metric='Pass_ANY/A')

Calculates average trajectory for QBs drafted at similar position
Groups by draft slot (e.g., picks 1-5, 6-10, 11-20, 21-32)
Returns: Average trajectory + confidence intervals

compare_qb_to_slot_average(qb_trajectory, slot_average)

Calculates how QB performed vs. their draft slot expectation
Identifies years above/below average
Returns: Comparison metrics
