set up scripts to auto run based on current year

to investigate:
//////////////////////////////////////////later//////////////////////////////////

do an article on biggest differences between my model and what actually happened, and why?

What is the probability for payment of the unsigned QBs in their last year at the team (year0-6)

is injury removal and performance extrapolation more predictive of behavior or not adjusting?

whether or not teams use the 5th year option for those with L&H or H&L production in practice

Add in all the other rounds of QBs

What is the most predictive with % of salary cap at signing
    what is second beyond year of signing? (assuming this is nr 1)

get_draft_slot_average_trajectory(draft_position, metric='Pass_ANY/A')
    Calculates average trajectory for QBs drafted at similar position
    Groups by draft slot (e.g., picks 1-5, 6-10, 11-20, 21-32)
    Returns: Average trajectory + confidence intervals

compare_qb_to_slot_average(qb_trajectory, slot_average)
    Calculates how QB performed vs. their draft slot expectation
    Identifies years above/below average
    Returns: Comparison metrics
