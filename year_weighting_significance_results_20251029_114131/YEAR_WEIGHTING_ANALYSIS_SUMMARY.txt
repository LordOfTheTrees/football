INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
================================================================================

üìà P-VALUE INTERPRETATION:
- P_Value_Bootstrap < 0.05: Statistically significant year
- P_Value_Bootstrap < 0.01: Highly significant year
- P_Value_Bootstrap < 0.001: Very highly significant year
- Significant_95 = True: 95% confidence interval doesn't include zero

üìà TIMES_SIGNIFICANT INTERPRETATION:
- Times_Significant = 4: Year is significant in all 4 decision years (3,4,5,6)
- Times_Significant = 3: Year is significant in 3 out of 4 decision years
- Times_Significant = 0: Year is never statistically significant

üìà COEFFICIENT INTERPRETATION:
- Positive coefficient: Higher performance in that year increases payment probability
- Negative coefficient: Higher performance in that year decreases payment probability
- Larger absolute coefficient: Stronger effect of that year's performance

RESEARCH FINDINGS:
================================================================================

üèÜ MOST IMPORTANT YEARS FOR PAYMENT DECISIONS:
Check year_significance_summary_*.csv and sort by Times_Significant (descending)

üèÜ MOST STATISTICALLY ROBUST FINDINGS:
Look for years with:
- Times_Significant ‚â• 3 (significant in most decision years)
- Avg_P_Value < 0.05 (consistently low p-values)
- Large Avg_Weight_% (high importance across decision years)

BUSINESS IMPLICATIONS:
================================================================================

üéØ FOR QB EVALUATION:
- Focus scouting on performance years that are consistently significant
- Weight recent vs. rookie year performance based on statistical findings
- Use significance results to justify evaluation frameworks

üéØ FOR CONTRACT TIMING:
- Years with low p-values are reliable predictors
- Decision year analysis shows when each year's performance matters most
- Optimize contract negotiation timing based on which years matter

NEXT STEPS:
================================================================================

1. üìä Open year_significance_summary_*.csv in Excel
2. üîç Sort by Times_Significant to find most important years
3. üìà Compare total_yards vs Pass_ANY/A results for consistency
4. üìù Focus evaluation frameworks on statistically significant years
5. üéØ Use findings to optimize scouting and contract timing
